# [Discovery]
- Need to populate the scholarship db with working proper scholarships for year 2025 in order for this to actually work
- certain fields may need to be hard coded such as grades for requirements as most scholarship requirements are not structured. 

# [Eligibility Simplifier]
- Ensure eligibility for the current user and have a filter to show eligible scholarships based on current profile

- Need to vectorise scholarships somehow perhaps using a set of keyword that include amount, name and benefits and vectorise them. Then perform a deterministic and similarity check to ensure that scholarships match user's requiremnts such as grades. Or if too complex we just use gemini to check requirements due to ambiguous nature of data. 

# [Application Tracker]
- A user should be able to apply to a scholarship which will bring the user to a tracking dashboard 

# [Scenario based]
- Would have different states, essay (due date), role play for group study and interview markers
